## What framework or rendering library should I use?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <br/>
  All applications must use React as a rendering library. Feel free to use any other **libraries or framework to enhance React capabilities**.

  Our most popular bundle right now is Create React App + React Router but we are actively exploring Next.js so you should consider it.

## Should I use TypeScript?

You must use TypeScript. **The only exceptions are if you’re** developing a proof of concept or a library for which the type of code makes it unpractical and slow to develop with TypeScript. 

If you are developing one of those libraries, you are still expected to provide types with the library package. It’s also highly recommended to at least write TypeScript JSDoc for your functions.

## Should I use Next.js?

The answer tends toward a “yes” but we are still investigating. A few of ShareGate’s projects are experimenting with Next.js. If you are starting a new project, reach out to the technology team on Slack to talk about your options.
